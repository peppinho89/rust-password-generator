# ü¶Ä Rust PwdGen

**Rust PwdGen** is a simple **password generator and strength checker** CLI application built with Rust. This project was created for **educational purposes** to practice Rust and explore CLI development. It is not intended for production use but serves as a fun way to learn Rust by building something useful along the way. Plus, it generates QR codes for your passwords!

## ‚ú® Features

**Generate Secure Passwords**:
- Customize the length and character set (special characters, numbers, uppercase).

**Password Strength Checker**:
- Evaluate the strength of an existing password with a built-in strength assessment.

**QR Code Generation**:
